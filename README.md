## Description

Books are the best! This app is a simple book list generator. It allows a user to search for and save their favorite books to a list on their profile. It works by querying the google books API and utilizes mongo DB and GraphQl. I had some trouble converting it from a REST api to graphQl with apollo server but after reading some documentation it all came together. Due to time contraints for another project I am working on, I was unable to complete all the functionality but I certainly learned alot!
